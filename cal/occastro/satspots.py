and 3) a clean occulted focal-plane image wiht the same relative DM setting

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_ref : numpy ndarray
        2-D image = "a clean occulted focal-plane image with a base DM setting"
    img_plus : numpy ndarray
        2-D image = "a clean occulted focal-plane image with a relative

        2-D image = "a clean occulted focal-plane image wiht the same relative
                     DM setting satellite-spot subtracted"

    xOffsetGuess, yOffsetGuess : float
        Starting guess for the number of pixels in x and y that the star is
        offset from the center pixel of the spots image. The convention
        for the center pixel follows that of FFTs.

    thetaOffsetGuess : float (degrees)
        theta rotation of spot locations on camera might be different from
        expected because of clocking error between the DM and the camera. Such
        clocking angle is measured with DM registration.

    fn_offset_YAML : str
        Name of the YAML file containing the tuning parameters for offset
        estimation.

    fn_separation_YAML : str
        Name of the YAML file containing the tuning parameters for separation
        estimation.

    Returns
    -------
    star_xy = [xOffsetEst, yOffsetEst] : list of floats
        Estimated lateral offsets of the stellar center from the center pixel
        of the spots image. The convention for the center pixel follows
        that of FFTs.

    list_spots_xy = [[x_0, y_0], [x_1, y_1], ...] : list of x,y duples floats


    Notes
    -----
    Offset Tuning parameters in the offset YAML file are explained below:

    spotSepPix : float
        Expected (i.e., model-based) separation of the satellite spots from the
        star. Used as the starting point for the separation for the center of
        the region of interest. Units of pixels. Compute beforehand as
        separation in lambda/D multiplied by pixels per lambda/D.
        6.5*(51.46*0.575/13)
    roiRadiusPix : float
        Radius of each region of interest used when summing the intensity of a
        satellite spot. Units of pixels.
    probeRotVecDeg : array_like
        1-D array of how many degrees counterclockwise from the x-axis to
        rotate the regions of interest used when summing the satellite spots.
        Note that a pair of satellite spots is given by just one value. For
        example, for a single pair of satellite spots along the x-axis use
        [0, ] and not [0, 180]. And for a plus-shaped layout of spots,
        use [0, 90].
    nSubpixels : int
        Number of subpixels across used to make edge values of the region-of-
        interest mask. The value of the edge pixels in the ROI is the mean of
        all the subpixel values.
    nSteps : int
        Number of points used along each direction for the grid search.
        Odd numbers are better to provide symmetry of values when the array is
        truly centered.
    stepSize : float
        The step size used in the grid search. Units of pixels.
    nIter : int
        Number of iterations in the loop that hones in on the radial separation
        of the satellite spots.

    Separation Tuning parameters in the separation YAML file are explained
    below:

    spotSepGuessPix : float
        Expected (i.e., model-based) separation of the satellite spots from the
        star. Used as the starting point for the separation for the center of
        the region of interest. Units of pixels. Compute beforehand as
        separation in lambda/D multiplied by pixels per lambda/D.
        6.5*(51.46*0.575/13)

        satellite spot. Units of pixels.

        use [0, 90].

        interest mask. The value of the edge pixels in the ROI is the mean of
        all the subpixel values.

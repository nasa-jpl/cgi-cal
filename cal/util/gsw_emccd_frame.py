    """Get data from EMCCD frame and subtract the bias and bias offset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frame_dn : array_like
        Raw EMCCD full frame (DN).
    meta : instance
        Instance of Metadata class containing detector metadata.
    fwc_em : float
        Detector EM gain register full well capacity (DN).
    fwc_pp : float
        Detector image area per-pixel full well capacity (DN).
    em_gain : float
        Gain from EM gain register, >= 1 (unitless).
    bias_offset : float
        Median number of counts in the bias region due to fixed non-bias noise
        not in common with the image region.  Basically we compute the bias
        for the image region based on the prescan from each frame, and the
        bias_offset is how many additional counts the prescan had from extra
        noise not captured in the master dark fit.  This value is subtracted
        from each measured bias.  Units of DN.


    Attributes
    ----------
    image : array_like
        Image section of frame (DN).
    prescan : array_like
        Prescan section of frame (DN).
    al_prescan : array_like
        Prescan with row numbers relative to the first image row (DN).
    frame_bias : array_like
        Column vector with each entry the median of the prescan row minus the
        bias offset (DN).
    bias : array_like
        Column vector with each entry the median of the prescan row relative
        to the first image row minus the bias offset (DN).
    frame_bias0 : array_like
        Total frame minus the bias (row by row) minus the bias offset (DN).
    image_bias0 : array_like
        Image area minus the bias (row by row) minus the bias offset (DN).

        """Fix cosmic tails, get cosmic and tail masks.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sat_thresh : float
            Multiplication factor for fwc that determines saturated cosmic
            pixels.
        plat_thresh : float
            Multiplication factor for fwc that determines edges of cosmic
            plateau.
        cosm_filter : int
            Minimum length in pixels of cosmic plateaus to be identified.
        cosm_box : int
            Number of pixels out from an identified cosmic head to mask out.
            For example, if cosm_box is 3, a 7x7 box is masked,
            with the cosmic head as the center pixel of the box.
        cosm_tail : int
            Number of pixels in the row downstream of the end of a cosmic
            plateau to mask.  If cosm_tail is greater than the number of
            columns left to the end of the image-area row from the cosmic
            plateau, the cosmic masking ends at the end of the row in the
            image-area output called "mask".  For the output called
            "mask_full", though, the full length of cosm_tail is masked by
            wrapping to the next row in the full frame if necessary.
            Defaults to 10.

        Returns
        -------
        mask : array_like, int
            Image-area mask for pixels that have been set to zero.
            The cosmic ray masking per row can
            go at furthest to the end of the image row
            (and cannot wrap to the next row).
        mask_full : array_like, int
            Full-frame mask for pixels that have been set to zero.
            The cosmic ray masking can go to the end of a full-frame
            row and wrap to the next one if the tail is chosen to be long
            enough.  To get an image area with this more general masking,
            one can take an image-area slice of this output using the Metadata
            class.

def remove_cosmics(image, fwc, sat_thresh, plat_thresh, cosm_filter, cosm_box,
                   cosm_tail, meta=None, mode='image'):
    """Identify and remove saturated cosmic ray hits and tails.

    Use sat_thresh (interval 0 to 1) to set the threshold above which cosmics
    will be detected. For example, sat_thresh=0.99 will detect cosmics above
    0.99*fwc.

    Use plat_thresh (interval 0 to 1) to set the threshold under which cosmic
    plateaus will end. For example, if plat_thresh=0.85, once a cosmic is
    detected the beginning and end of its plateau will be determined where the
    pixel values drop below 0.85*fwc.

    Use cosm_filter to determine the smallest plateaus (in pixels) that will
    be identified. A reasonable value is 2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array_like, float
        Image area of frame (bias of zero).
    fwc : float
        Full well capacity of detector *in DNs*.  Note that this may require a
        conversion as FWCs are usually specified in electrons, but the image
        is in DNs at this point.
    sat_thresh : float
        Multiplication factor for fwc that determines saturated cosmic pixels.
    plat_thresh : float
        Multiplication factor for fwc that determines edges of cosmic plateau.
    cosm_filter : int
        Minimum length in pixels of cosmic plateaus to be identified.
    cosm_box : int
        Number of pixels out from an identified cosmic head (i.e., beginning of
        the plateau) to mask out.
        For example, if cosm_box is 3, a 7x7 box is masked,
        with the cosmic head as the center pixel of the box.
    cosm_tail : int
        Number of pixels in the row downstream of the end of a cosmic plateau
        to mask.  If cosm_tail is greater than the number of
        columns left to the end of the row from the cosmic
        plateau, the cosmic masking ends at the end of the row. Defaults to 10.
    meta : Metadata class instance
        Metadata class instance, which is used to determine whether the
        beginning of a plateau is not in the image area, in which case no 
        cosmic ray masking should occur.  Only relevant when mode is 'full'.
        Defaults to None, in which case masking is allowed anywhere on the 
        input frame.
    mode : string
        If 'image', an image-area input is assumed, and if the input
        tail length is longer than the length to the end of the image-area row,
        the mask is truncated at the end of the row.
        If 'full', a full-frame input is assumed, and if the input tail length
        is longer than the length to the end of the full-frame row, the masking
        continues onto the next row.  Defaults to 'image'.

    Returns
    -------
    mask : array_like, int
        Mask for pixels that have been set to zero.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm uses a row by row method for cosmic removal. It first finds
    streak rows, which are rows that potentially contain cosmics. It then
    filters each of these rows in order to differentiate cosmic hits (plateaus)
    from any outlier saturated pixels. For each cosmic hit it finds the leading
    ledge of the plateau and kills the plateau (specified by cosm_filter) and
    the tail (specified by cosm_tail).

    """
    Load a YAML file located at a given path

    All filenames may be absolute or relative paths.  If relative, they will be
    relative to the current working directory, not to any particular location
    in the repository.

    Arguments:
     path: string containing path to file; can be absolute or relative

    Keyword arguments:
     custom_exception: Exception class to use when raising errors.  Defaults to
      Exception if none is specified.

    Returns:
     contents of YAML file as a Python object.  Note that this object does no
     parsing or validation of this data; this must be handled by the calling
     function.
